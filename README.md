# pollen

**Work in progress**

Pollen provides the capability for an external application to observe Flor's behaviors via its hooking facility using an HTTP interface just like Github's webhooks. Specifically, it reports over:

1. flow creation/launch
2. task return (aka reply or proceed)
3. flow termination
4. cancellation
5. errors

## Instructions
TBD

## TODO
- hook handler error handling with persistency (queue)
- better log handling / debug
